Joshâ€™s Evaluation

While working with evander we worked quite well, but we could have improved our time management skills and organisation. I felt that we did most of the work at home, and this reduced our ability to communicate easily. As a result, I think that our website could have been better. 

While working, we faced quite a few errors and difficulties, but we worked well together to fix them. For example, the problem with the type of player, buttons, and the Instagram feed. We also had loads of git problems but we eventually resolved them. We had good cooperation and good teamwork but I feel that we could have worked on our organisation more.

Although we faced a lot of problems, I think that our website turned out good because of all the hard work that we put into it. I think we could have added a few more features but we didn't spend enough time on them. 

I also feel that we allocated our jobs well and time to each section accordingly. Both of us had main jobs to do and we completed them well. For example, Evander spent most of his time with the planning and the rest of the other things, while I worked on the site. I think this helped us increase our efficiency, especially since we could not work on the website at the same time due to difficulties with branches on git. 

Overall i think we worked great as a team!
