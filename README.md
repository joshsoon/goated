# Our Plan
We want to make a GoatedBballÂ® Website which has a number of pages. So in total we have 4 pages: our homepage, quizzes page, quiz 1 page and quiz 2 page. 

On all pages we have:
    Title, subtitle, footer and icons with links to social media. 

Home Page Description:
    Quote, picture of Andre, some place holder text, and a small biography.

On our main quizzes page we have:
    Two quizzes to choose from, with an interactive hover concept, and images for the quizzes. 

On each of the minor quiz pages, "What's your Basketball IQ", and "How much do you know?", 
    we have multiple questions from in the quiz, and at the end, you are englightened by your result of the quiz. After the quiz, there is a button which allows you to go back to home page easily.
