# Our Plan
We want to make a GoatedBballÂ® Website which has a number of pages. So in total we have 5 pages: our homepage, quizzes page, instagram feed page, quiz 1 page and quiz 2 page. 

On all pages we have:
    Title, subtitle, footer and icons with links to social media. 

Home Page Description:
    Quote, picture of Andre, some place holder text, and a small biography.

Instagram Page Description:
    Some text saying to follow @goatedbball (you should too), and 9 posts from the official goatedbball instagram account. These all have links to the actual posts, and a link to follow the instagram account. 

On our main quizzes page we have:
    Two quizzes to choose from, with an interactive hover concept, and images for the quizzes. 

On each of the minor quiz pages, "What's your Basketball IQ", and "How much do you know?", 
    We have multiple questions from in the quiz, and at the end, you are englightened by your result of the quiz. After the quiz, there are buttons which allow you to go back to home page and the quiz page easily.
