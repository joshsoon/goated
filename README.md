# Website Description
We aim to make a GoatedBballÂ© Website, primarily featuring various quizzes and in addition a page showcasing some of the most popular @goatedbball Instagram posts (check them out!). So in total we have 5 pages: our homepage, quizzes home page, instagram feed page, IQ quiz page, trivia quiz page, type of player quiz, and results pages for each of the quiz pages. 

On all pages we have:
    Title, subtitle, footer and icons with links to social media (Google, Yotuube and Instagram). 

Home Page Description:
    Famous Quote from Jayden Buman, picture of Andre, about header, about description/biography, and two button links to instagram page and quizzes home page.

Instagram Page Description:
    Some text saying to follow @goatedbball (you should too), and 9 popular posts from the official goatedbball instagram account. These all have links to the actual posts, and can actually show the posts without going on the instagram website, and a link to follow the instagram account.

On our quizzes home page we have:
    Three multiple-choice quizzes: IQ quiz, trivia quiz and type of player quiz (respectively). Each quiz has a respective image above the interactive hover button taking the user to the quiz. 

Multiple choice quiz format: 
    There is a top bar with the name of the Quiz on the left, and on the right is a box showing the time. Underneath there is the question number followed by the actual question and underneath that is a column of the possible answers and the next question button taking the user to the next question. Once all questions are completed, the user wil be taken to the end results page.

On each of the quiz pages, "What's your Basketball IQ", and "How much do you know?", 
    We have multiple-choice questions from the quiz, and at the end, you are englightened by your result of the quiz as shown by Raghav Bux (10 Raghav bux is correspondent to 1 correct answer). After the quiz, there are buttons which allow you to go back to home page and the quiz home page easily. Just to note, on the IQ Quiz below the multiple choice box there is a embedded youtube video showing different situations, and the user has to choose what sitation would be the best action to take. Additionally, since there is a youtube video to load it may take a while to load the page.

On the "What type of player are you" quiz, 
    It is similar to the to the other two quizzes, however there are no Raghav Bux awarded and there is no right answer as it simply just determines what type of player you play like. And so depending on which answer you pick, you are awarded either 10, 20, 30 or 40 points, and on the end type of player results page it details what type of player you play like depending on your score range.
