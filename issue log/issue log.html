git problems - linking up with our repository, problems with branches, problems with pushing and pulling and setting up our repository. Evander in particular had a multitude of issues regarding the pushing of his changes to the remote git repository, as everytime it asked him to do a remote git add, he would have to reclone the repository into a new folder, however, he found a solution through other means and ever since it has been good. 

problems with navigation bar - colour choice and opacity, links as well, and animations did not work at first 

problems with instagram feed - problems with formatting the instagram posts, and i couldnt count how many there were properly. 

problems with icons and links - we had normal icons and changed them, but that resulted in more problems as the spacing was very shaky. At the end, the icons looked great

problems with quizzes - formatting issues and a large amount of javascript issues, formatting in css to make it look nice, results page especially - lots of problems, especially the type of player quiz, since we tried to make it automatic but we could not. evander tried multiple quiz formats and wasted a lot of time until he finally made one which he liked. 

problems with photos - difficulties with spacing and formatting to fit on the page smuggly and uniformly

problems with buttons - formatting the buttons and colour
