Evander’s evaluation
In my web development task to make a computer program, I was in a pair with Josh and overall I think we generally worked well together. We had good communication and teamwork, and in the end I think our website turned out not too bad. Also we allocated roles to each person on what to do and generally we followed our 4 week time plan and did each of our tasks pretty well and independently. For example, I primarily worked on the javascript elements of the quiz which was the majority of our website, whereas Josh worked on the css elements and styling of our websites to make it look aesthetic.

However we did encounter a few issues and our time management wasn’t the best as we decided to leave some things to the last minute. Also, while I was working on the quizzes, especially the type of player quiz, I initially wanted to make the process of determining what type of player you are automatic by using an if else statement
If 123 < points < 456 { text “you play like player1!”}
However, for some reason I could not get it to work as it would determine points as the initial points which I defined points as, that is 0 points, and although the user would get questions right and points added, and although in the end page it would show the end score still the issue persisted and it would always say you played like the player I stated with the minimum amount of points (Goran Dragic). And so I just decided to add text showing the different ranges of the points and the corresponding players. Also, for some reason I couldn’t make another variable called score, which would show the score out of the number of questions, and although I could make a variable showing the points (raghav bux), I couldn’t get it to work. There were also other problems and issues such as the buttons and instagram pages, but those issues were mainly resolved by Josh as he was concerned with those parts of the website. However overall, if we had better time management we maybe could have resolved these images with time. Also, I had a lot of problems with git as I couldn’t push and it would always come up with errors, and also we tried to make branches but it just didn’t work and messed up our git setups, so we just decided to work one by one and tell each other when we were working, which was okay but not as efficient and desirable as one person would just be helping or doing research but not really doing anything.

If I were to do a similar task project in the future, next time I would keep our teamwork, cooperation and communication I had with Josh as it was quite efficient, and also our task allocation and management was quite good and we worked quite independently and well, but next time I would try to configure git so we can work simultaneously without only one person doing stuff, and I would also try to learn more of the applications of the coding languages, primarily javascript as I wanted to resolve some of the issues but simply didn’t have enough time. However, overall I think I worked pretty well with Josh and I’m happy with what we achieved in the end.
